# alx-airbnb-database: database-script-0x01

This repository contains the SQL schema definition for an AirBnBâ€‘style application, designed as part of the ALX Holberton School curriculum. It defines all core entities (users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, messages), their relationships, constraints, and performance indexes.

## Contents

* **schema.sql**: PostgreSQL DDL script that:

  * Enables UUID generation
  * Creates necessary ENUM types
  * Defines tables with appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints
  * Adds indexes for performance
  * Implements trigger for automatic `updated_at` maintenance

* **README.md**: This document.

## Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL 12+ with superuser privileges
* `uuid-ossp` extension available
* psql (or any SQL client) to run the DDL script

## Setting Up

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-airbnb-database.git
   cd alx-airbnb-database/database-script-0x01
   ```

2. **Connect to PostgreSQL**

   ```bash
   psql -U <your_db_user> -d <your_database>
   ```

3. **Run the schema script**

   ```sql
   \i schema.sql
   ```

   This will create all tables, types, constraints, indexes, and triggers.

## Schema Overview

| Table        | Description                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `users`      | Registered users (guests, hosts, admins) |
| `properties` | Listings owned by hosts                  |
| `bookings`   | Reservations made by guests              |
| `payments`   | Payments for bookings                    |
| `reviews`    | Guest reviews of properties              |
| `messages`   | In-app messaging between users           |

### Key Features

* **UUID PKs**: All primary keys use `UUID` for uniqueness across distributed systems.
* **ENUM Types**: Roles, booking statuses, and payment methods enforced at the database level.
* **Timestamps**: Automatic creation timestamps; `properties.updated_at` auto-updates on change.
* **Referential Integrity**: Cascading deletes to keep data consistent.
* **Indexes**: Added on foreign keys and frequently queried columns for performance.

## Next Steps

* Write migration scripts (e.g., using Flyway or Django migrations)
* Seed initial data for testing
* Integrate with application code (ORM models)
* Add advanced features: availability calendars, location indexing (PostGIS)
